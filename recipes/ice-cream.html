    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 vanilla bean (optional but recommended)</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, combine the heavy cream, whole milk, and granulated sugar. Place the saucepan over medium heat and stir the mixture until the sugar dissolves completely. This will create the sweet and creamy base for our vanilla ice cream.</li>
        <li>If using a vanilla bean, split it open lengthwise with a sharp knife. Scrape out the tiny black seeds (vanilla caviar) and add them to the cream mixture. Also, add the scraped vanilla bean pod to infuse the mixture with an extra layer of flavor.</li>
        <li>Continue to heat the mixture until it reaches a gentle simmer. Do not let it come to a boil. Once simmering, remove the saucepan from the heat and allow the vanilla mixture to steep for about 20-30 minutes. This will allow the flavors to meld and intensify.</li>
        <li>If you opted not to use a vanilla bean, simply add the pure vanilla extract to the cream mixture after it has steeped. The extract should be of high quality to ensure the best vanilla essence.</li>
        <li>Next, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, removing any leftover vanilla bean pod or other particles. This will ensure a smooth and luscious consistency for your ice cream.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, making sure it touches the surface of the cream mixture. This prevents a skin from forming. Chill the mixture in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or, preferably, overnight. Chilling is essential for achieving the perfect ice cream texture.</li>
        <li>Once the mixture is thoroughly chilled, pour it into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions. The churning process will aerate the ice cream, giving it that signature creamy texture.</li>
        <li>Transfer the freshly churned ice cream to a lidded container and freeze for an additional 2-3 hours, or until it reaches the desired firmness. The ice cream is now ready to be scooped and savored.</li>
        <li>Serve the Creamy Vanilla Ice Cream in bowls or cones, garnishing with fresh berries, a sprig of mint, or your favorite toppings. Enjoy this heavenly treat with loved ones and let its timeless flavors take you on a nostalgic journey of pure delight.</li>
