    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sliced pepperoni</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature possible (usually around 500°F/260°C). Preheating is essential for achieving that perfect crispness and gooey cheese.</li>
        <li>If using store-bought pizza dough, allow it to come to room temperature and follow the package instructions for any required preparation. If using homemade dough, ensure it is well-rested and rolled out into your desired pizza shape.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease a pizza pan or baking sheet with olive oil. Place the prepared pizza dough on the pan, using your hands to stretch and shape it to your desired thickness. A thin crust will yield a crispier pizza, while a thicker crust will be chewier.</li>
        <li>Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. The sauce acts as the flavor foundation for your pizza, so feel free to adjust the amount to suit your taste.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce, ensuring each bite is rich and cheesy.</li>
        <li>Now, generously distribute the sliced pepperoni across the pizza. The pepperoni's spiciness and savory flavors will add an irresistible kick to your pizza.</li>
        <li>Season your pizza with dried oregano, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper flakes (if desired). A dash of crushed red pepper will intensify the heat, but you can skip it if you prefer a milder taste.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the pizza with olive oil to enhance the flavors and promote browning during baking.</li>
        <li>Season the pizza with a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust turns golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned on top.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a minute or two before slicing it into wedges.</li>
        <li>Serve your hot and delectable Classic Pepperoni Pizza, and watch it disappear in no time as you relish the combination of tangy sauce, gooey cheese, and the tantalizing taste of pepperoni.</li>
    </ol>
