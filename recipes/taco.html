    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef or turkey (or your preferred protein)</li>
        <li>1 packet taco seasoning mix (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded lettuce</li>
        <li>1 cup diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced onions</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup salsa (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>8 small flour or corn tortillas</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Lime wedges for serving</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a skillet over medium heat, add vegetable oil and heat it until shimmering. Add the ground beef (or your chosen protein) to the skillet and cook until browned and fully cooked through. Break the meat into crumbles as it cooks for even texture.</li>
        <li>Drain any excess fat from the meat and return it to the skillet. Add the taco seasoning mix and follow the package instructions or your homemade recipe to combine the spices with the meat. Allow the meat to simmer for a few minutes, absorbing all the savory flavors.</li>
        <li>While the meat simmers, prepare the taco toppings. Shred the lettuce, dice the tomatoes and onions, and chop the fresh cilantro. Arrange the toppings in individual bowls for easy assembly.</li>
        <li>Warm the tortillas on a clean skillet or directly over an open flame for a few seconds on each side until they become pliable. This step ensures that your tacos are soft and easy to fold.</li>
        <li>Now it's time to assemble your tacos. Spoon a generous portion of the seasoned meat onto the center of each tortilla.</li>
        <li>Add your desired toppings, such as shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, diced onions, shredded cheddar cheese, fresh cilantro, sour cream, and salsa. Feel free to customize your tacos to suit your taste preferences.</li>
        <li>Squeeze a splash of lime juice over the fillings to enhance the flavors and add a refreshing zing.</li>
        <li>Fold the tortillas in half to form your delicious tacos, enclosing the flavorful fillings.</li>
        <li>Serve the freshly made tacos immediately, providing lime wedges for an extra burst of citrusy goodness.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your flavor fiesta as you savor each delightful bite of these Savory Tacos. Whether you're hosting a taco night with friends or having a satisfying meal with your family, these handheld treats are sure to bring joy to your dining experience.</li>
